# Hack Juno

The previously announced Moneta Hacks have been on-going for some time. Many people have been working hard on cool dapps and protocols, leading them to ask a burning question... wen?

The answer is NOW.

## The History of Hack Juno

When Juno launched, 4% of initial token distribution were set aside for Hack Juno prizes. Why? Simply because without cool things being built that people could use, the chain wouldn't be worth much.

Unlike the EVM ecosystem, the CosmWasm smart contract ecosystem has yet to fully develop. Hack Juno funds were intended to jump start CosmWasm smart contract development by incentivising developers to learn and build.

It worked! The first Hack Juno, organized by Core 1, started before Juno even launched, and some of the projects that emerged from it included JunoSwap, JunoMint, JunoTools, the early beginnings of DAO DAO, and more!

It was decided that the second part of Hack Juno would be broken into four phases, each with 287500 Juno as prizes (a total of 1149600 Juno). [An article was written about it](https://medium.com/@JunoNetwork/the-moneta-hacks-open-innovation-on-the-jun%C3%B8-interoperable-smart-contract-network-73152e82c295), but then we got distracted. Prop 16 and other monumental events sucked up a lot of energy; and even though devs were building, little progress was made on the Hack Juno front.

This lack of progress was one of the cheap motivations for embracing SubDAOs to scale Juno's growth and development, which will become an important component in the long term success of Juno.

The community DAO voted in favour of the proposed [general principles under which SubDAOs should operate](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/25), and then voted to [instantiate a Hack Juno SubDAO](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/27). Which brings us to today.

## Hack Juno SubDAO

The Hack Juno SubDAO has been officially been instantiated. It's purpose is to organize and run Hack Juno. You can view the DAO [here](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1q7ufzamrmwfw4w35azzkcxd5l44vy8zngm9ufcgryk2dt8clqznsp88lhd).

It's members consist of:
- [Jake Hartnell (Core 1 / DAO DAO)](https://twitter.com/JakeHartnell)
- [Kevin Garrison (Oni Validator / Terra Dev Fund)](https://twitter.com/KevinGarrison)
- [Max Juno (Wombat)](https://twitter.com/max_maxsolo)
- [Amber Case (DAO DAO / Earth+)](https://twitter.com/caseorganic)
- [Nullmames (Kingnodes / Juno Contributor)](https://twitter.com/nullMames)
- [Julius Lattke (Interchain UX Designer and founder of DesignDAO)](https://twitter.com/JuliusLattke)
- [Dylan Schultzie (Lavender.Five Nodes)](https://twitter.com/dylanschultzie)

Members of the Hack Juno SubDAO will not be eligible for receiving Hack Juno prizes. Organizing and running Hack Juno will be at the descretion of the SubDAO, including decisions with regard to prizes and their amounts.

## How to participate

Hack Juno is primarily for developers, as it is designed to incentivize people building and launching dapps on Juno. That said, designers and product contributions are also eligible, but you have to ship something useful that people can use.

Teams and individuals will be evaluated on the value they're creating for the Juno ecosystem. Quality code / design / ux / documentation, will score highly.

If you've already been building, great! You've got a head start. If not, well then it's time to get started.

## The Process

The process is simple:

1. Build something cool.
2. Tweet about it and tak @HackJuno.
3. Submit form the [form](HTTP://).
4. Get nominated by one of the DAO judges (just one has to like your application).
5. Judges evaluate your project and vote.
6. Rewards will paid out in batches by the Hack Juno SubDAO.

The Hack Juno SubDAO may modify this process at any time should the need arise. Any modifications will be communicated via the Hack Juno [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/HackJuno). 

## F.A.Q

**Q: I already have been building something, am I eligible?**

Yes.

**Q: I've been promoting Juno on Twitter, am I eligible?**

No, not for Hack Juno.

**Q: I've contributed to technical documentation, am I eligible?**

Yes, though we will be looking through your work. If it's something that is already well documented, that you copy pasted into a Medium article, don't be sad if you don't get a prize.

That said, documentation is an extremely valuable contribution.

**Q: Do I have to pay taxes on the prize?**

The answer will depend on your country, but yes, probably.

**Q: I deployed a DAO on DAO DAO, am I eligible?**

No. Merely using tools built by others does not push the Juno ecosystem forward.

**Q: What won't score well?**

- Projects that aren't open source
- Anyone who spams the submission system or judge's DMs
- Projects that fork someone elses code to try and pass it off as their own
- Projects that don't work or have large security vulnerabilities
