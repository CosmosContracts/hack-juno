# How to earn points

1. **Write smart contracts**

   The most points will be given to individuals or teams that create useful Smart Contracts.

   * CosmWasm docs: https://docs.cosmwasm.com/
   * Example contracts: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-plus

2. **Make docs, videos, stack overflow responses, blog posts, etc.**

   For the Cosmos ecosystem take off, we also need tutorials and documentation. Standout examples of Juno related content will receive rewards.

3. **Build other useful tools**

   Amazing tools and user interfaces also bring immense value to the Juno ecosystem and will be recognized. Some ideas might include, but are not limited to, UI for uploading / interacting with smart contracts or community tools such as balance checkers & bots.
