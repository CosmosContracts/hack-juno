# Smart Contract Competition

Juno is having a smart contract competition with [INSERT_PERCENT]% of the total Juno Supply as a prize.

We hope this will lead to a cambrian explosion of useful money legos for the Cosmos ecosystem.

#### Four phases

The competition is four phases:

1. **Initial Development**
   Build your initial contracts and deploy them on the Juno Testnet. On {INSERT_DATE}, individuals / teams will submit PRs with links to their Smart Contracts repo. Judges will judge them.

2. **Submit funding proposals**
   Projects seeking to continue will submit funding proposals on chain. Funding proposals will be capped at a certain number of Juno and voted on by the community.

3. **Launch V1 contract on the Juno Mainnet**
   Extra rewards will be given for making live and functional contracts on Juno Mainnet.

4. **Maintain it for a year**
   Extra rewards will be given for being responsive to the community, fixing bugs, doing audits, upgrading contracts, etc.

   These rewards will be evaluated at 6 months and 1 year after the end of phase 3.

**BONUS ROUND: community choice awards (voted on chain).**

# How to earn points

1. **Write smart contracts**
   The most points will be given to those individuals or teams that create useful Smart Contracts.

2. **Make docs, videos, stack overflow responses, blog posts, etc.**
   For the Cosmos ecosystem take off, we need also need tutorials and documentation. Standout examples of Juno related content will receive rewards.
